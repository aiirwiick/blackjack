I didn't use any data strucutures outside of Python's list since simulating a deck of cards isn't a particularly large task and doesn't require using anything more complicated. (e.g. taking a card from the top of the deck is similar to popping off an element from the front of the list). I also didn't use any algorithms.

I used Python because I feel like the code is more simple to read and more appropriate in this use case since there are not many data structures and efficiency is not a huge issue.
